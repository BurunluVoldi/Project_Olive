# Project_Olive
internship project

First use xampp and activate Apache and SQL server...
Then you have to create tables in that order:
-instructors (columns:id/username/password/name/mail/fax/room)
-listings (columns:id/author/title/text)
id columns must be primary key and auto_increment must be checked.

You can manually add some authors and listings for test cases.

Goal of this project is creating a portal for students and instructors. Instructors can enter entries and anonymous students can display it from personal devices.
